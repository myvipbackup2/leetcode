### 记录一下刷 leetcode 或者其他面试 编程题


1. [使用原生JS，找出HTML中出现次数最多的标签并输出](https://github.com/myvipbackup2/leetcode/blob/master/findTheMost.html)

2. [Two Sum](https://github.com/myvipbackup2/leetcode/blob/master/TwoSum.html)

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
    
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    _Example:_

    ```
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```
