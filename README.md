1. [使用原生JS，找出HTML中出现次数最多的标签并输出](FindTheMost.html)

2. [Two Sum](TwoSum.html)

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
    
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    _Example:_

    ```
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```
3. [Roman to Integer](Roman_to_Integer.html)
    
    Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
    
    Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
    
4. [Reverse Integer](ReverseInteger.html)
    
    Reverse digits of an integer.
    
    ```
    Example1: x = 123, return 321
    Example2: x = -123, return -321
    ```
5. [Reverse String](ReverseString.html)

    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
    
    _Example:_
    
    ```
    Given s = "hello", return "olleh".
    ```

6. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.html)
   
   Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   
   _Examples:_
   
   ```
    Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
    
    Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    
    Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
   ```
